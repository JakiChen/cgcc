 title: Meeting men wherever they are
 summary: Biological clock is a gendered term. It’s a symbol of the one-sided conversation that has traditionally—and wrongly—treated fertility as a woman’s issue. Legacy has started the other half of that dialogue. By calling men to the table, they’re helping fathers and aspiring parents understand and protect their role in creating life with from-home sperm testing and cryostorage. And as their partner, it was our role to eliminate the taboo around male fertility—to make every man feel welcome.
